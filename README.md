# Generating an executable file

First you need to download textures and models from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kCsZu0TfSNmvxzYq-5BjYgyNHyVL6BXy?usp=sharing and move the Resources folder to the Assets folder, so that the contents of Resources folder from git and the downloaded one end up togeather.

In order to generate an executable file it is required to have 2022.3.11f1 version of Unity Editor. You also need to have an adequate plug-in installed, depending on what platform the game has to run on.

Application has been made and tested on Windows and Android, so on other platforms the game may not be working.

If plug-ins are installed (for windows there are none reqiured), you need to go to these options: File > Build Settings.

Then select the platform you want to build game for. Afterwards press "Build" button.

The .apk file for Android needs to be moved to a phone with Android system (version 5.1 or higher) and then installed.
The .exe file for Windows (Windows 7 or newer version) has to be next to in the location of other game files, or be moved with them.

The Builds made by us in advance are accessible by this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GGJ9TpqIZbaHULy7mfka4kZRfbHC1isy?usp=sharing .
